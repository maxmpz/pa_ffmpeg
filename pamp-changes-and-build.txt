FFMpeg Poweramp changes and building

PAMP_CONFIG_NO_VIDEO
- no video codecs and some video related logic is removed

PAMP_CONFIG_FLOAT_ONLY_RESAMPLER
- non-float resamples removed

PAMP_CHANGES
- options removed
- some codecs patched

PAMP_CONFIG_NO_TAGS
- all tags are skipped, except replaygain and gapless

PAMP_DISABLE_NEON_ASM
- some arm + neon optimizations are skipped (as they tend to be slower on real devices)

Build process:
- use appropriate build-neon.sh or build-arm64.sh

$ export ANDROID_NDK=your ndk dir (android-r10e+)
$ cd audioplayer_ffmpeg_swresample/jni
$ ./build-neon.sh
$ cd ../../jni
$ ./build-neon.sh

Poweramp has "overridden" c/S files in /jni. Still, .h files can't be overriden this way, thus, they are kept both in jni and should be copied over the ffmpeg tree
FFmpeg configure basically works as intended, except external libraries detection (doesn't work currently, no pkg-config in ndk and/or it seems that crosscompile libs
not necessarily easily configured this way anyway). External library config variables are enabled in per-build config scripts (config.h/config.mak from config-pamp.h/config-pamp.mak).

Os vs O3 + neon tree
- mp3 - benifits from local O3 by realtime .3%
- aac - no dif
